# End-To-End ML Project: Spam Classification üöÄ

This project implements a Neural Network Classifier for Spam Classification, achieving 98% accuracy and deployed on AWS. It covers the complete lifecycle of an ML project from data collection to deployment.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model for spam email classification using a Neural Network. Key phases of the project include:

- **Data Collection:** Utilized a dataset of spam and non-spam emails for training the classifier.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Developed a Neural Network model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify emails.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Deployment:** Deployed the trained model on AWS using Streamlit for interactive web application deployment.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model, emphasizing the importance of deployment skills for aspiring Data Scientists and ML engineers.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework used to build and train the Neural Network model.
- **Streamlit:** Used for building and deploying the web application for model inference.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Cloud platform used for model deployment.
- **Joblib:** Library used for saving and loading models.
- **Scikit-learn:** Used for various machine learning utilities including metrics calculation and data preprocessing.
- **NLTK and WordCloud:** Used for natural language processing and visualization tasks.
